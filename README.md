# Overview
<p>This repository contains my coding practice of constructing some advanced data structures using very primitive ones with the guidance from an online course. </p>
<p>While I was taking this course, I was also taking a university course about data structures and algorithms using C. Personally, I am very interested in Java, and this course aims to teach data structures through DIY building, so I decided to take this online course as a supplement. </p>

# What I have learned
1. More coding experience in Java.
2. A better understanding about recursion, which is frequently used in a tree structure.
3. A much better understanding about the common data structures in the programming world through implementing some of them myself.
4. If you are determined and willing to spend time looking under the hood, data structures are comprehensible.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank one of the best instructors I have ever seen - Yubo Liu, who delivered this course in a clear and efficient way.
