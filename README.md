# Overview
This repository contains my coding practice of constructing advanced data structures using primitive ones.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank one of the best instructors I have ever seen - Yubo Liu, whose course allows me to get a better understanding about data structures and algorithms in a clear and efficient way.
