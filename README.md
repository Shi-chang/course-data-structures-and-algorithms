# Overview
This repository contains my coding practice of constructing advanced data structures using very primitive ones.

# What have I learned
1. More coding experience in Java.
2. A better understaing about recursion, which is frequently used in a tree structure.
3. A much better understanding about the common data structures in the programming world through implementing some of them myself.
4. As long as you are willing to spend time looking under the hood, data structures are comprehensible.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank one of the best instructors I have ever seen - Yubo Liu, who delivered this course in a clear and efficient way.
