# Overview
<p>This repository contains my coding practice of constructing some advanced data structures using very primitive ones with the guidance from a online course.</p>
<p>While I was taking this course, I was also taking a university course about data structures and algorithms using C. Personally, I am very interested in Java, so I decided to take this online course as a supplement.</p>

# What have I learned
1. More coding experience in Java.
2. A better understaing about recursion, which is frequently used in a tree structure.
3. A much better understanding about the common data structures in the programming world through implementing some of them myself.
4. As long as you are willing to spend time looking under the hood, data structures are comprehensible.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank one of the best instructors I have ever seen - Yubo Liu, who delivered this course in a clear and efficient way.
